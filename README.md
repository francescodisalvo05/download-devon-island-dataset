## To do
- parametrize the kind of images that we want [color-raw-1280x960, grey-rectified-512x384, color-rectified-1280x960]
- create a custom function in order to define the for loop just once
- define a custom order for the selected scenes (and check their consistency)

### How to run
1. Copy the shell file inside your project
2. Set up the number of train/test/set scenes you need (within the code)
3. Run the script

```sh 
get_data.sh
